## About Me

Nice to meet you! I‚Äôm Eduard, an economist and administrative specialist in billing. I'm working hard to become a data scientist and business analyst. If you want to chat, don‚Äôt hesitate to connect üòÑ

I‚Äôve always liked economics as a tool to understand the world üåç and Excel as my best ally to organize it üìä. When I discovered econometrics and dedicated my thesis to the market analysis of tourist rentals, I knew I wanted to work in the field of data analysis. I aim to bring significant value to the technical aspects of a data scientist with my knowledge in economics and finance.

Since graduating, I have been working as an administrative specialist in billing and CRM for the energy sector, a position I have enjoyed and am glad to have taken.

Recently, I completed a master in Data Science & Business Analytics and I am in the process of moving to Barcelona with my partner.
